 I worked on a mobile dataset analysis project where I explored customer preferences, mobile trends, and brand performance.

💡 What I Did:

Organized and cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy.
Used SQL techniques like Joins, Aggregations, and Subqueries for detailed analysis.
Uncovered patterns in pricing, features, and customer satisfaction.
🔍 Key Insights:
1️⃣ Most sought-after features influencing purchase decisions.
2️⃣ Price bands with the highest customer satisfaction.
3️⃣ Top-performing mobile brands based on customer reviews and sales.
